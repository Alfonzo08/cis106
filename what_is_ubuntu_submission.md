# Ubuntu
![desktop image](desktop.png)

Ubuntu is a [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.
Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for [Internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)devices and robots. All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine. Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack. Ubuntu's default desktop has been
GNOME since version 17.10.


Ubuntu is developed by British company **Canonical**, and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model. Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release,starting from the release date and until the release reaches its designated **end-of-life (EOL) date**.
Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu and donations from those who download the Ubuntu software. Ubuntu is named after the **Nguni philosophy** of ubuntu, which Canonical indicates means *"humanity to others"* with a connotation of *"I am what I am because of who we all are"*.

## Background


> Ubuntu is built on Debian's architecture and infrastructure, and comprises Linux server, desktop and discontinued phone and tablet operating system versions. Ubuntu releases updated versions
predictably every six months, and each release receives free support for nine monthThe
recommended system requirements are:s (eighteen months prior to 13.04) with security fixes, high-impact bug fixes and conservative, substantially beneficial low-risk bug fixes. The first release was in October 2004.

Current long-term support (LTS) releases are supported for five years, and are released every two years.
Since the release of Ubuntu 6.06, every fourth release receives long-term support. Long-term support

includes updates for new hardware, security patches and updates to the 'Ubuntu stack' (cloud computing
infrastructure). The first LTS releases were supported for three years on the desktop and five years on theserver; since Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, desktop support for LTS releases was increased to five years as well. LTS releases get regular point releases with support for new hardware and integration of all the updates published in that series to date.


### Features

A default installation of Ubuntu contains a wide range of software that includes LibreOffice,
Firefox,Thunderbird, Transmission, and several lightweight games such as Sudoku and Mines.Many 
additional software packages are accessible from the built in Ubuntu Software (previously Ubuntu
Software Center) as well as any other APT-based package management tools. Many additional software
packages that are no longer installed by default, such as Evolution, GIMP, Pidgin, and Synaptic, are still
accessible in the repositories and installable by the main tool or by any other APT-based package
management tool. Cross-distribution snap packages and flatpaks are also available,that both allow
installing software, such as some of Microsoft's software, in most of the major Linux operating systems(such as any currently supported Ubuntu version and in Fedora). The default file manager is GNOME Files,formerly called Nautilus.

#### Security

Ubuntu aims to be secure by default. User programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the
operating system or other users' files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary
privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps
prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security
holes. Polkit is also being widely implemented into the desktop. The recommended system requirements
are:ftware into four domains to reflect differences in licensing and the degree of support available. Some
unsupported applications receive updates from community members, but not from Canonical Ltd.

officially recommended for most users. It is designed for desktop and laptop PCs and officially supported
by Canonical. A number of variants are distinguished simply by each featuring a different desktop

**How to Update Ubuntu**

First, open the terminal in Ubuntu desktop. You can find it in the menu, or use the Ctrl+Alt+T keyboard
shortcut. If you are logged on to an Ubuntu server, you already have access to a terminal.

In the terminal, you just have to use the following command:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

The `-y` in the end automatically enters “yes” when the command “apt upgrade” ask for your confirmation
before installing updates. Note that you can also use the two commands separately, one by one:

>sudo apt update
 sudo apt upgrade
